    <h5>Mission Statement</h5>

    <p>The Influenced Mission Statement: We are The Influenced, a digital news platform dedicated to helping Gen Z, Millennials and everyone in between make empowered, informed decisions about the content they consume and where they spend their money online.</p>  

       <p>These days, as influencers take up more and more of our digital real estate, it’s hard to distinguish reality from meticulously curated fiction. Sure, influencers probably have a public and a private persona, but what happens when who they are IRL contradicts the messages they send through their branding? Should influencers who preach body positivity be promoting diet products?</p>
        
        <p>And then there are the latest must-have gadgets, like the $600 Dyson Air Wrap, the gua sha, and heatless curlers. How safe and effective are these trends? Are we giving influencers too much power over our wallets, our psyches, and ourselves?</p>
        
       <p>We’re here to help you understand whether the influencer lifestyle is attainable or merely aspirational. We are here to keep you from getting influenced.</p>
